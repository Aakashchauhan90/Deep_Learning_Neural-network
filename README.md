# Deep_Learning_Neural-network
Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application
We will use the functions you'd implemented in the previously to build a deep network, and apply it to cat vs non-cat classification. Hopefully, We will see an improvement in accuracy relative to your previous logistic regression implementation.

Let's get started!

1 - Packages

numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
matplotlib is a library to plot graphs in Python.
h5py is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
PIL and scipy are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.
dnn_app_utils provides the functions implemented in the "Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step" assignment to this notebook.
np.random.seed(1) is used to keep all the random function calls consistent. It will help us grade your work.
